## About
TruPS is a cloud service providing cloud machine learning functionalities.

Machine learning model training and encrypted inference are supported, with encrypted inference being achieved through fully homomorphic encryption
based on TFHE by leveraging Zama ConcreteML library.

By using TruPS users can seamlessly train machine learning models in plaintext and have them be available for private encrypted inference.

There are four supported machine learning models:
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Decision tree regressor
- Decision tree classifier

Fully homomorphic encryption is still fairly unknown and through this cloud service we aim to provide a somewhat easy way to try out fully homomorphic encryption in combination with machine learning.
