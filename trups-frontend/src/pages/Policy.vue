                <h4 id="the-right-of-access-to-personal-data">The right of access to personal data</h4>
                <p>Using a user’s written consent (e.g. via e-mail), Random Red, as the data controller, provides the user with an access to personal data processed about them, informs them about the processing purpose, types of processed data, recipients or categories of recipients to whom personal data have been or will be disclosed, estimated processing period or criteria used to determine that period.</p>
                <h4 id="the-right-to-correct-inaccurate-data">The right to correct inaccurate data</h4>
                <p>Being the data controller, Random Red will enable the correction of inaccurate personal data in each individual case when determined that the collected personal data are inaccurate or has been changed.</p>
                <h4 id="the-right-to-delete-personal-data">The right to delete personal data</h4>
                <p>Random Red will delete the user’s personal data in the following cases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a) when the user’s personal data are no longer necessary to achieve the processing purpose, i.e. termination of the processing purpose unless a special law prescribes the storage period of personal data (for example, when a special law prescribes permanent data storage);</li>
                    <li>b) when the user withdraws one’s consent as a legal basis for data processing and there is no other legal basis for data processing;</li>
                    <li>c) when the user objects to data processing (see more under the Right to object);</li>
                    <li>d) when personal data have been illegally processed;</li>
                    <li>e) where personal data must be deleted in order to meet legal obligations under the European Union law or the Member State law to which the data controller is a subject.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4 id="the-right-to-restrict-data-processing">The right to restrict data processing</h4>
                <p>Random Red will limit personal data processing in cases when the user disputes data accuracy, processing is illegal and the user opposes to data deletion seeking to restrict their use instead, when the data controller no longer needs personal data for processing but the user requests data for meeting legal requirements as well as when the user objects to personal data processing including developing user profiles.</p>
                <h4 id="the-right-to-object">The right to object</h4>
                <p>The user has the right to object to the processing of one’s personal data if the data are not legally processed by the data controller. In this case, Random Red, as the data controller, will stop processing personal data.</p>
